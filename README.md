# VyaparMedia — India's Premier Influencer Marketing & Escrow Marketplace

> **Production Platform Baseline** | Next.js 16.2.6 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript 5 · Prisma ORM · Base UI · Tailwind CSS · Upstash Redis · Razorpay

VyaparMedia is an enterprise-grade fintech and marketing marketplace connecting direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, digital marketing agencies, and corporate sponsors with verified content creators through legally binding digital contracts, milestone-based escrow payments, and automated Indian tax compliance (TDS Section 194-O, GST, PAN).

## 1. Key Value Propositions

- **100% Escrow Protection**: Upfront brand funding locked in double-entry ledger escrow holds. Eliminates creator payment default and brand delivery risks.
- **Digital Reputation Score (DRS 0–900)**: Algorithmic creator credibility rating based on on-time delivery rates, verified review sentiment, dispute history, and fraud flags.
- **Legally Binding Digital Contracts**: Cryptographic SHA-256 contracts with itemized deliverables, revision terms, and dual digital signatures.
- **Automated Indian Tax Compliance**: Real-time Section 194-O (0.1%), Section 206AA (5%), and Section 194J TDS calculations, GST state-code extraction, and encrypted PAN verification.
- **Zero-Trust Anti-Disintermediation**: Real-time contact leak detection (phone, email, UPI, external messaging handles) preventing off-platform platform bypass.
- **Accessible Instagram-Inspired Design**: OLED dark mode, 44pt minimum touch targets, `tabular-nums` financial counters, and WCAG 2.1 AA dual-coded semantic indicators.

## 3. SEO Sitemap (`src/app/sitemap.ts`)

Next.js dynamically generates `/sitemap.xml` for search indexing:

```text
https://vyaparmedia.in/             (Priority: 1.0, Weekly)
https://vyaparmedia.in/campaigns    (Priority: 0.8, Hourly)
https://vyaparmedia.in/leaderboard  (Priority: 0.7, Daily)
https://vyaparmedia.in/about        (Priority: 0.6, Monthly)

https://vyaparmedia.in/terms        (Priority: 0.3, Monthly)
https://vyaparmedia.in/refund       (Priority: 0.3, Monthly)
https://vyaparmedia.in/cookie-policy(Priority: 0.3, Monthly)

Robots directives (`src/app/robots.ts`) grant crawler access to public pages while strictly disallowing private and administrative sections (`/api/*`, `/admin/*`, `/dashboard/*`).
