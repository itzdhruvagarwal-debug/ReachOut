    question: "How does VyaparMedia ensure 100% upfront escrow protection?",
    answer:
      "When a brand hires a creator or creates a milestone deal, the full agreed campaign budget is deposited upfront into an RBI-compliant Razorpay Escrow account. Neither the brand can cancel without reason nor can the creator demand unearned funds. Payouts are released systematically upon milestone review and live post verification.",
  },
  {
    category: "Escrow & Safety",
    question: "What happens if a creator fails to post or delivers substandard content?",
    answer:
      "VyaparMedia has a built-in Dispute Resolution Center. If a creator fails to meet agreed deliverables within the contract deadline, or delivers content violating the creative brief, the brand can trigger a dispute review. If unrectified, the escrow funds are refunded to the brand according to our transparent Refund Policy.",
  },
  {
    category: "Creators",
    question: "Do creators have to pay any platform commission or withdrawal fees?",
    answer:
      "No! Joining VyaparMedia, applying to brand campaigns, and receiving payouts is 100% free for creators. The agreed fee you see on the campaign brief is the exact gross amount you earn upon approval. Zero hidden agency cuts.",
  },
  {
    category: "Creators",
    question: "How quickly do creator payouts hit my bank account?",
    answer:
      "Once your live post is verified by our automated system or approved by the brand, funds from escrow are initiated immediately via RazorpayX (IMPS / UPI) and typically settle into your linked Indian bank account within 24 hours.",
  },
  {
    category: "Brands",
    question: "How does the 10% platform fee work for brands?",
    answer:
      "VyaparMedia charges a flat, transparent 10% escrow processing and mediation fee on the funded campaign budget. This covers digital smart contracts, KYC verification, live post crawling, dispute arbitration, and GST compliance. There are no monthly retainer fees or setup costs.",
  },
  {
    category: "Taxes & Legals",
    question: "How are GST and TDS (Section 194J) handled?",
    answer:
      "VyaparMedia provides automated B2B GST tax invoices for all campaign transactions. For brands required to deduct TDS under Section 194J (Fees for Professional / Technical Services), our system generates automated quarterly TDS credit schedules and tax reports.",
  },
