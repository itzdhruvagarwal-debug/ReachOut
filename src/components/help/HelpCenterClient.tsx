  // 1. Getting Started
  {
    id: "gs-1",
    category: "GETTING_STARTED",
    question: "What is VyaparMedia and how does the marketplace work?",
    answer:
      "VyaparMedia is India's leading escrow-secured influencer marketing platform. Brands can discover verified creators across Instagram and YouTube, agree on structured deliverables (Reels, Stories, Dedicated Videos), and deposit funds into RBI-compliant escrow. Funds are released to creators only after deliverables are submitted, reviewed, and approved.",
    badgeText: "Platform Overview",
  },
  {
    id: "gs-2",
    category: "GETTING_STARTED",
    question: "Can I use VyaparMedia as both a Creator and a Brand?",
    answer:
      "Yes. During registration, you select your primary role (Creator or Brand). However, our flexible account management allows switching roles from Dashboard Settings if your agency also produces creator collaborations.",
    badgeText: "Account Roles",
  },
  {
    id: "gs-3",
    category: "GETTING_STARTED",
    question: "How do brands send offers to creators?",
    answer:
      "Brands can explore creator rate cards via the public creator profile or discovery feed, and click 'Send Collab Offer' or 'Invite to Campaign'. Deliverables, deadlines, and milestones are transparently specified before any funds are committed.",
    badgeText: "Collaborations",
  },

  // 2. Payments & Escrow
  {
    id: "pe-1",
    category: "PAYMENTS_ESCROW",
    question: "How does 100% Escrow Protection work?",
    answer:
      "When a brand hires a creator, the agreed commercial fee is deposited into a safe escrow holding account. The creator starts production knowing payment is 100% guaranteed, and the brand is protected knowing funds are released only when content meets guidelines and is approved.",
    badgeText: "Escrow Safety",
  },
  {
    id: "pe-2",
    category: "PAYMENTS_ESCROW",
    question: "What are the TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) deduction rates?",
    answer:
      "In compliance with Section 194-O and 194C of the Indian Income Tax Act, TDS is automatically calculated: 0.1% for PAN-verified creators earning above annual thresholds (or 5% if PAN is unverified). TDS certificates (Form 16A) are downloadable directly from your Wallet Statement tab quarterly.",
    badgeText: "Tax & Compliance",
  },
  {
    id: "pe-3",
    category: "PAYMENTS_ESCROW",
    question: "How fast are creator wallet payouts processed?",
    answer:
      "Once escrow is released upon milestone approval, earnings reflect immediately in your VyaparMedia Wallet. Withdrawals to verified Indian bank accounts via IMPS / NEFT or UPI are initiated within 30 minutes with zero hidden transfer charges.",
    badgeText: "Instant Withdrawals",
  },
  {
    id: "pe-4",
    category: "PAYMENTS_ESCROW",
    question: "What platform fees does VyaparMedia charge?",
    answer:
      "VyaparMedia charges a transparent 5% platform escrow protection fee to brands upon deal funding. Creators receive 100% of their quoted rate minus applicable statutory TDS. There are zero subscription or listing fees.",
    badgeText: "Fee Transparency",
  },

  // 3. Disputes & Revisions
  {
    id: "dr-1",
    category: "DISPUTES_REVISIONS",
    question: "How many revisions can a brand request on submitted content?",
    answer:
      "The standard contract includes up to 2 revisions by default (unless customized in the deal terms). Brands must provide specific timestamped feedback within 72 hours of content submission. Creators have 48 hours to upload the revised draft.",
    badgeText: "Revisions Policy",
  },
  {
    id: "dr-2",
    category: "DISPUTES_REVISIONS",
    question: "What happens if a creator fails to submit content before the deadline?",
    answer:
      "If the submission deadline lapses without delivery or mutual extension, the brand can trigger an automatic cancellation. Escrowed funds are returned 100% to the brand's wallet or original payment method without penalty.",
    badgeText: "Missed Deadlines",
  },
  {
    id: "dr-3",
    category: "DISPUTES_REVISIONS",
    question: "How does the Dispute & Arbitration process work?",
    answer:
      "If a brand and creator cannot agree on revisions or delivery standards, either party can open a formal Dispute from the Deal Room. Funds remain locked in escrow while a 48-hour mutual resolution window opens. If unresolved, a VyaparMedia senior arbitrator reviews creative briefs, raw drafts, and chat records to issue a binding settlement or split payout.",
    badgeText: "Arbitration",
  },

  // 4. KYC & Security
  {
    id: "kyc-1",
    category: "KYC_SECURITY",
    question: "Why is Aadhaar & PAN KYC mandatory for creators?",
    answer:
      "To prevent fraud, impersonation, and sybil attacks, VyaparMedia requires government identity verification (Aadhaar OTP + PAN verification) before wallet withdrawals can be unlocked. Identity data is encrypted and verified against government databases without storing raw biometric data.",
    badgeText: "Identity Verification",
  },
  {
    id: "kyc-2",
    category: "KYC_SECURITY",
    question: "What is the Creator DRS (Dynamic Reliability Score)?",
    answer:
      "The DRS is a 0–900 trust index calculated from on-time delivery rates, revision compliance, brand ratings, and dispute-free history. Creators with 800+ DRS earn the 'Elite Creator' badge and receive priority placement in brand discovery feeds.",
    badgeText: "DRS Trust Score",
  },
  {
    id: "kyc-3",
    category: "KYC_SECURITY",
    question: "How does VyaparMedia protect user contact information?",
    answer:
      "To safeguard users from off-platform advance fraud and fee-avoidance scams, in-app chat features automated contact-leak detection that flags phone numbers, personal UPI IDs, and WhatsApp links until a deal contract is officially escrow-funded.",
    badgeText: "Safety & Privacy",
