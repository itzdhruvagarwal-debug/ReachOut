        <p>
          VyaparMedia operates an automated milestone escrow architecture designed to safeguard both brand investments and creator compensation. When a brand funds a campaign, the capital is locked in an RBI-regulated escrow account and is only disbursed to the creator once contractual milestones are fulfilled and verified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Refund eligibility is determined strictly by the deal progression stage, submission timestamps, and verified deliverable compliance against the agreed Statement of Work (SOW).
