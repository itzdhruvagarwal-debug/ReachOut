        <p>
          By creating an account, browsing campaigns, submitting proposals, or depositing funds on VyaparMedia, you enter into a legally binding contract governed by these Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          VyaparMedia operates as a technology intermediary providing workflow automation, identity verification, milestone escrow ledgers, and dispute mediation tools. We do not act as an advertising agency, employer, tax advisor, or commercial bank. Brands and creators contract directly with one another through structured Statements of Work (SOW) executed on the platform.

        <p>
          To maintain an ecosystem free of fraud and bot manipulation, VyaparMedia implements tiered identity verification:

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-3">
          <li><strong className="text-foreground">Creator Verification:</strong> Mobile OTP verification, PAN record matching, and social handle authentication. High-value tiers require bank account verification via IMPS penny drop.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-foreground">Brand Verification:</strong> Official corporate email domain, GSTIN certificate validation, and registered company address matching.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Any attempt to forge KYC documents or submit synthetic identity credentials will lead to immediate account termination, forfeiture of unlawful gains, and reporting to financial authorities.

          <li>Creators must deliver original, non-infringing creative assets by the contractual milestone deadlines.</li>
          <li>Brands are allotted a standard review window (typically 72 hours) upon submission. If no revision or dispute is initiated within this window, the platform may trigger automated approval.</li>
          <li>Promotional posts must remain live on the creator&apos;s authenticated profile for the contractual retention period (standard 30–60 days).</li>
